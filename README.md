# AlphaDot: An AI Algorithm for Dots and Boxes

## Description

AlphaDot is an AI algorithm designed for the game *Dots and Boxes* for the course project of CS4386 in CityU. In this project, students are asked to design AI algorithms and the final score will be determined by the success rate when the algorithm fight against all other studentsâ€™ algorithms.

The rule of the game is that: Players alternate drawing a horizontal or a vertical line between adjacent dots - if they complete a box then they score 1 point (per box) and get another turn. The player with the most points once all of the boxes have been completed wins. This game is also popular in game platforms such as Switch game [*Clubhouse Games 51 Worldwide Classics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clubhouse_Games:_51_Worldwide_Classics).
